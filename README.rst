========

State machine implementation for Python objects.


How to install
--------------

The project is at a very early stage, there's no PyPi release.


How to run tests
----------------

Just run::

    make test

for install all test dependencies (`Should-DSL <http://www.should-dsl.info>`_
and `Specloud <https://github.com/hugobr/specloud>`_, at the moment) and
run the tests. Fluidity itself has no dependencies.
