Features
========

This page is intended to list Invoke's feature set in more detail than is
useful in the ``README``. It is not always 100% exhaustive, however - when in
doubt, skimming the rest of the docs and/or using the search field is highly
recommended!

.. note::
    This page always reflects the latest stable release. To find out when a
    given feature was added, see `the changelog <changelog>`.

Generally, Fabric's features fall under three main areas: **subprocess
execution**, **task organization**, and the **command-line tool** (though the
latter two are strongly related.)

Subprocess management
=====================

A much more full-featured approach to what you might get from the standard
library's ``subprocess`` module:

- Execute arbitrary shell command strings
- Simultaneously captures program output while allowing full interaction

Task organization

Command-line tool
