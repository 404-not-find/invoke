Specific things to improve:

* Loader.load_collection should get broken up into multiple smaller
  methods.

Big questions:

* How to go from subprocess.PIPE to something custom which is capable of
  middleware-type functionality (e.g. logging, mutating etc)?
* How to handle global settings without requiring all functionality to be
  method calls on an object?
